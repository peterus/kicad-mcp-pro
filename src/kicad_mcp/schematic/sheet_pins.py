"""Pure planning and S-expression emission for hierarchical sheet pins.

KiCad joins a child sheet's ``hierarchical_label`` nodes to the parent sheet
symbol through ``(pin ...)`` nodes inside the parent's ``(sheet ...)`` block.
Without them the sheets are electrically separate: ERC reports
``hier_label_mismatch`` for every label, and a net that crosses sheets appears
twice in the netlist instead of once.

Everything in this module is text in, text or data out -- no file access, no
``kicad_sch_api``, no FastMCP. That is deliberate. A ``kicad_sch_api`` load/save
round trip of a real root schematic is node-count clean but silently drops
``(comment N ...)`` nodes from the ``title_block``, so sheet pins are spliced
into the document text instead of reserializing it. It also makes the geometry
exhaustively unit-testable without KiCad installed.
